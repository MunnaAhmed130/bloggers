            "description": "Researchers confirmed an exoplanet, a planet outside our Solar System, using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope for the first time. Formally classified as LHS 475 b, the exoplanet in the constellation Octans and is relatively close at only 41 light-years away. LHS 475 b is almost exactly the same size as Earth, with a diameter of 99% that of Earth’s. Kevin Stevenson and Jacob Lustig-Yaeger, both from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, led the research team who reported on the finding. The team’s results were presented at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) press conference on January 11, 2023. \n  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, infrared-optimized space telescope launched in December 2021 and became fully operational in the Summer of 2022. One unique feature of the JWST is that it focuses on detecting infrared light.   \n     In physics, light is electromagnetic radiation that can be modeled as synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields. Together, these fields form a propagating electromagnetic wave. The wavelength, or distance between peaks of the wave, determines where on the electromagnetic spectrum it falls.   \n  Our human eyes can only detect visible light, which makes up only a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light ranges from red (at about 700 nanometers wavelength) to violet (at about 400 nanometers wavelength). Infrared light is electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths slightly longer than red visible light. \n   Studying the infrared light emitted by astrophysical phenomena has some marked advantages over observing at visible light. Stars and planets form in clouds of dust, and this dust obscures our view; infrared light better penetrates these clouds and is thus easier to detect. Furthermore, stars that radiate at lower temperatures, such as red dwarfs, emit more strongly in the infrared light regime. The star LHS 475 b orbits around is a red dwarf, which makes the JWST an ideal observer. \n In its short time in operation, the JWST has already observed distant galaxies from the beginning of our Universe and has even characterized the atmospheres of some already-known exoplanets. The JWST has now achieved another significant milestone: discovering its very first exoplanet.  \n    The team chose to observe this target with the JWST after carefully reviewing data from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which hinted atbut did not confirm the planet’s existence. JWST’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument was able to confirm the planet’s existence easily and clearly, with only two transit observations. \n  “There is no question that the planet is there. Webb’s pristine data validate it,” said Lustig-Yaeger in a NASA press release. “The fact that it is also a small, rocky planet is impressive for the observatory,” Stevenson added. \n So, now to address the question on everyone’s mind: is LHS 475 b capable of supporting life? To answer this, scientists look to the planet’s atmosphere for clues. At the time of this writing, the JWST is the only operating telescope able to characterize the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. The team attempted to assess LHS 475 b’s atmospheric composition by analyzing the planet’s transmission spectrum.    "
